# Inferential-Statistics-Project
Final project demonstrating probability, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA using Python.

This project is part of the PGPDS.O.MAR25.A coursework. It involves the application of inferential statistics on real-world datasets to solve problems related to:

- Football player injuries and probability
- Breaking strength of packaging materials
- Brinell hardness of stone surfaces
- ANOVA testing on dental implant hardness

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience in designing and testing statistical hypotheses.
- Understood how assumption violations affect statistical test outcomes.
- Learned to interpret p-values and test statistics in real-world decision-making.

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Techniques Used

- Descriptive statistics
- Probability theory (joint, marginal, conditional)
- Z-score & normal distribution
- One-sample and two-sample t-tests
- One-way and two-way ANOVA
- Interaction effect analysis
- Shapiro-Wilk and Leveneâ€™s tests for normality and homogeneity of variance

## ðŸ“Š Skills Demonstrated
- Probability Calculations
- Hypothesis Testing (One-sample and Two-sample t-tests)
- ANOVA (One-way and Two-way)
- Interaction Effects
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
